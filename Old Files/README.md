# Project1

## Team Name: Aaber Analytics
## Project Goal:
To tell a story  about reported crime throughout the City of Austin through a data analysis and visulization of the City of Austin Crime Reports dataset publicly available in
the City of Austin Open Data Portal.

## Methodology
+ Create a [shared GitHub repository](https://github.com/atmetz/project1)
+ Modularize the project workload to simulate industry standards by creating these branches (main | development | feature | feature | ...)
+ Access the [City of Austin Open Data Portal - Crime Reports](https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu)
+ Conduct a high-level overview of the dataset characteristics
+ Generate hypotheses about crime throughout the City of Austin
+ Click on the third menu item [View Data | Visualize | Export | APO | ...] to open a pop-up window select CSV to beging downloading the data as a CSV file.
    * Move and save the downloaded CSV file to a location the analysis and visualization code can reliably access.
    * Execute the CSV_RZL.ipynb file to convert the CSV file into a Pandas dataframe.

+ Click on the fourth menu item [View Data | Visualize | Export | APO | ...] to access the [API docs](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.austintexas.gov/fdj4-gpfu)
    * Execute the API_RZL.ipynb file to grab the entire dataset, storing it in a Pandas dataframe.
+ Start an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the data
+ Based on the EDA revise the original hypotheses as needed
+ Cenerate draft slideshow presentations
+ Practice presentations as a team
+ Present to the class
+ Receive a tautological while loop of laudatory plausits from fellow classmates and instructors.
    * Q -> ChatGPT: "Would a tautological while loop be a creative way of saying an infinite while loop?"
    * ChatGPT A -> Aaber Analytics(member = "Robert"): "Yes, a tautological while loop would be a way of expressing an infinite while loop. Tautology means the repetitive use of words or phrases, so a while loop that repeats indefinitely can be described as tautological."
